                    You are invited to participate in an online study that
                    involves observing, interacting with, and making judgments
                    about simple stimuli on a web-based interface, in this case
                    fonts. Your responses will be recorded. Specifically, we
                    collect non-identifiable data about your responses during
                    the study, including mouse clicks and keyboard presses. We

                    identifiable information about your session time and IP

                    information will only be stored in a secure database and
                    only for the duration of data collection. This information
                    will be stripped from the datasets prior to any academic
                    publications. Your session should last for up to 60 minutes.
                    You will be given full instructions shortly.
